# am-at-server: Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Run with docker

You'll need docker and docker-compose.

```
docker-compose up
./setup_db.sh
```

OR

Execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
./setup_db.sh
```

## Run locally
You'll need Python 3.5.2+

Execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
python3 setup_db.py
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```
